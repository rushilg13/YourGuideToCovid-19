                    <h2>David G. Vega</h2>
                    <h4><i>UI School Of Medicine, March 26, 2020</i></h4>
                  Yes, I tested positive for COVID-19. I fell victim to this virus: a nasty, lingering virus that gave me the worst symptoms I’ve experienced to this day that I wouldn’t wish upon anyone. My story is to warn you that this is not the common cold or a regular flu. This virus is serious. <br>

My name is David, and I am an otherwise healthy 27-year-old male with no past medical history. I am a fourth-year medical student, who will soon be a doctor starting residency in June. I am a health freak, I work out five to six times a week, I have a six-pack on a good day, and I completely took my health for granted.<br>

I thought I was INVINCIBLE—I thought I was immune to this coronavirus because I am healthy and young. But I was wrong.<br>

In early March, reports of novel transmission of the coronavirus were just starting to appear in the United States. I had heard about the nursing home in Seattle, the synagogue in New Rochelle, New York. It was a precarious situation, but community transmission of the virus was not quite so widespread.<br>

‘Sure, I’ll wash my hands,’ ‘I’ll social distance after that party,’ I thought. Looking back, there were too many opportunities for me to have caught this virus. I did not take my health seriously. I figured I could avoid the virus, but in the off-chance I were to get it, it would be like a mild flu or a bad cold. I flew home from a two-month global medicine elective in Africa, ventured on long flights home and around lots of people at Nairobi and JFK airport. I went to a beach party during my week stay in Florida and saw lots of friends before heading back to Indiana to finish up my last semester of medical school. I was not careful. I did not take the necessary precautions. I did not think it could happen to me.<br>

The fact of the matter is – you NEVER know.<br>

A day after arriving in Indiana, symptoms started to kick in. On Thursday, March 12, I woke up with fever, chills, fatigue, generalized muscle aches, and joint pain. Probably just a bad case of the flu, right? No cough, no shortness of breath, no difficulty breathing, no respiratory problems whatsoever. No nausea, no diarrhea. JUST Fever and chills.<br>

Thinking ‘I’ll get over it soon,’ I took some Ibuprofen and Tylenol and stayed in bed most of the day. The next day, I had a routine doctor’s appointment. I was almost turned away because of my symptoms, but I fought to be seen. My oral temperature was 101 degrees Fahrenheit, and I was put in an isolation room for my appointment. My provider, thankfully wearing complete PPE, performed a quick flu test (Influenza A, B, and RSV), which resulted negative that same day. It would later reflex to COVID-19 because of the negative result and I then began the seven-day wait for results.<br>

My symptoms, however, only continued to worsen. The fever was unrelenting. I had no appetite. I had lost about 10 pounds. I loaded up on my daily multivitamins and Emergen-C; I continued to use Ibuprofen and Tylenol every six hours because my body was asking for ANYTHING to take away the misery.<br>

It was not until Day 6 that I decided to drop the Ibuprofen after reading some expert opinions that NSAIDs may actually alter the immune response against the virus. Admittedly, I did feel WAY better the next day after dropping Ibuprofen. My fever and chills—although still present—felt improved. I continued to use only Tylenol spaced out now in the morning and before bedtime. By Day 7, still feeling chills in the morning, I opted out of using any Tylenol and tried to help my body fight this virus on its own. I attempted a little home bodyweight workout and instantly got lightheaded and felt very nauseous. My body was still desperately fighting this thing.<br>

Day 8: I woke up in the usual sweats from the night before, but felt no fever or chills during the day—I felt much improved. I told myself I would take it easy that day. I was begging and pleading to God for an end to all of this.
<br>
After waiting SEVEN ENTIRE DAYS in self-quarantine, I finally received my results: positive for COVID-19, continue self-quarantine for another seven days. Ironically, this arrived an hour before receiving my Match Day residency assignment for emergency medicine at the University of Miami. March 20th was certainly a big day of “results” for me.
<br>
By Day 13, I had not used any fever-reducing medicine in six days. For the last few days, my symptoms were mostly confined to nighttime-fatigue, sweats, chills, but by Day 13, all of my symptoms had completely gone away. I reintroduced exercise little by little and can now get through a whole hour workout without getting totally winded.
<br>
Why am I telling this story?
<br>
Because I encourage you to learn from my mistakes. Because I didn’t listen when numbers started climbing. And now they continue to climb. 55,000-plus patients diagnosed in our country, more than 1,000 people deceased.
<br>
Because this virus is REAL. And it SUCKS. To say it was almost two weeks before I was feeling like my normal self. Because I am a “healthy young adult,” but “mild” COVID-19 made my life a living hell.
<br>
Because people around the world are DYING from this virus—and doctors must make resource allocation decisions (e.g. in Italy) as to who should get that last ICU bed or that last ventilator because hospitals are at FULL CAPACITY. After returning from a two-month global medicine trip in Africa, I witnessed patients dying on a daily basis due to resource-allocation purposes. And now we are starting to see the same issues in New York City and other densely populated communities in the United States.
<br>
We NEED you to STAY HOME, because our health professionals are RUNNING out of masks for themselves and ventilators for patients. The CDC is so desperate that they recently issued new guidelines for health professionals to use bandanas and scarves as substitutes for N95 masks. We NEED you to STAY HOME because these health professionals are sacrificing their lives at the frontline to make sure those affected can stay alive.
<br>
I had the two biggest celebrations of my life canceled (Match Day and graduation) for the good of those around me and the rest of the country. Now is NOT the time to go to that party. Now is NOT the time to meet up friends at the bar, to go out to eat, to celebrate your spring break, to go to the beach or the park. I promise you, the celebration can wait.
<br>
So please, as a medical professional, as a young adult, I implore for all of you to STAY HOME. I firsthand can now see how this VIRUS takes LIVES. 1 out of 5 people hospitalized from COVID-19 are young adults aged 20-44; I was LUCKY to not be one of them.
<br>
As many as 10-20 percent of people show no symptoms, so you may be spreading this virus and injuring those you love without realizing it. We DON’T know who has it and who does not, and we do not have the resources to test everyone, so please STAY HOME. Social-distancing and self-quarantine is just as important for the ELDERLY as for the YOUTH.
<br>
We NEED you to do your part to FLATTEN the curve and prevent the growing spread to more and more people every day. If we all do our part, then this self-quarantine can eventually come to an end and we can soon resume what our lives used to be.
<br>
My name is David and I am NOT Invincible. And neither are you.

                    <h2>A COVID-19 Survivor's Physician</h2>
                    <h4><i>Anonymous</i></h4>
                    My conversation with her was the most memorable. She was elderly, in her seventies and African-American. Our visit was telephone-based without any face-to-face time even virtually; therefore, I’ve never met her. I don’t know what she looks like, but I can hear via our conversation that she seems to be a truly wonderful person. She followed up with me after a nearly weeklong hospitalization. There was a concern that her daughter may have brought the virus home to her unknowingly, and her sister was on another phone in the house. She sounded strong. She sounded resilient. Both of them, really all three of us, audibly gave praise to God that she survived.<br> <br>

Other family members could have been exposed, including the sister, and there were a few questions about that. She was my first patient who I knew of who tested positive for the COVID-19. She was also the first patient I ever directly was involved in caring for who survived. She was the first for me, personally and professionally, in so many ways. I shared that with both her and her sister. They, oddly, didn’t have a lot of questions. She was also found to be slightly hypertensive during her hospital course but was doing well with medication and dietary practices that were recommended during her hospitalization. We all laughed when she said to me, “Well, doctor, I guess I’m your number one.” I jokingly agreed. She will follow-up soon to have a repeat chest radiograph in four to six weeks. She had a right lower lobe pneumonia. I encouraged her to complete all antibiotics as prescribed.

          <h3>Facts About Covid-19</h3>
          <div class="fact">
          <br>
          <b>Will most people who get COVID-19 get very sick or die?</b><br>
FACT: Most people who get COVID­-19 will have a mild form of the illness and recover without needing professional medical care. Around eight out of every 10 people with COVID­-19 will have mild symptoms. Around one in six people will become severely ill and need hospital care. Scientific modelling suggests that around 1 in 100 people who get COVID-19 will die.<br><br>

<b>Can you always tell if someone has COVID-19?</b><br>
FACT: No The virus can be in someone’s body for up to 14 days before they get symptoms, and some people will have such a mild case of COVID-19 that they might not notice that anything is wrong. That’s why it’s important that everyone follows government advice – including hand washing, using tissues to catch coughs and sneezes, and avoiding crowds – to stop the spread of the virus, even if they feel healthy.<br><br>

<b>Can Black and African people get COVID-19?</b><br>
FACT: Anyone can get COVID-19, regardless of race or skin colour. Older people and people with other health conditions, such as asthma, heart diseases and diabetes, are more at risk of getting seriously ill. 
<br><br>
<b>Does COVID-19 only affect old people, meaning young people don’t have to worry?</b><br>
FACT: While COVID-19 can be more dangerous in older people, anyone can get it including young people, some of whom become seriously ill. While we don’t yet fully understand why some people get more serious symptoms, we do know that young people are more likely to develop serious symptoms if they have certain underlying health conditions, for example asthma, heart conditions or untreated HIV. 
<br><br>
<b>Are people living with HIV more likely to get seriously ill?</b><br>
FACT: If you are living with HIV and on effective treatment there's no evidence that you are at higher risk of developing serious COVID-19 symptoms. This is because your treatment will be keeping your immune system strong and your body able to deal with infections. If you are worried that you might have HIV, now is a good time to get tested so you can start treatment if you need it. 
<br><br>

<b>Will antiretroviral treatment (ART) for HIV stop me getting COVID-19?</b><br>
FACT: There is no evidence that taking anti-HIV drugs will stop you getting COVID-19. Although some ART drugs are being trialled for use to treat COVID-19, there is no evidence yet that they are effective for this purpose. 
<br>
If you are living with HIV and taking treatment it’s important that you follow the general advice to reduce the spread of COVID-19. Keep taking your treatment to ensure your immune system stays strong. You shouldn’t share your HIV drugs with anyone else who has COVID-19 or is worried about getting it. These should only be taken if prescribed by a doctor. 
<br><br>
<b>Can COVID-19 spread in warm sunny weather?</b>
<br>FACT: COVID-19 can survive temperatures higher than 25C. You can catch it no matter how sunny and warm it is. So, whatever the weather you should follow the official advice to protect yourself from the virus.

Getting out into the sunshine, if you can, is still a good idea as this helps your body produce vitamin D which is important for your immune system. 
<br><br>
<b>Will drinking lots of hot drinks stop COVID-19?</b><br>
FACT: There is no drink hot or cold that will protect you from COVID-19 or cure the illness. So far, there’s no proven cure for COVID-19 but most people recover by themselves. Taking paracetamol, drinking lots of liquids, and getting enough rest can help you manage your symptoms. 
<br><br>
<b>Should I use a strong disinfectant to clean my hands and body to protect myself from COVID-19?</b><br>
FACT: You shouldn’t use strong disinfectant to clean your body. Washing your hands thoroughly with soap and water or rubbing an alcohol-based sanitizer on them will stop the virus spreading. Using stronger chemicals on your skin can be dangerous. Never drink disinfectant or hand sanitizer as this can do serious damage.
<br><br>
<b>Can Chloroquine cure COVID-19?</b><br>
FACT: At the moment there is no proven cure for COVID-19, but most people will recover on their own without needing professional medical care. If you think you have COVID-19 and are having difficulty breathing, contact your local health facility as you will need professional medical care. 
<br>
As scientists and doctors continue their work to understand and treat COVID-19 our knowledge of, and ability to treat and prevent the virus will improve. For now, it’s important to follow official government advice and get information only from reliable sources like Avert.org, the World Health Organization (WHO) or your government’s health department.
